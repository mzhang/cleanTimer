# cleanTimer
A Java cube timer that's nice and clean! 

I couldn't find a single cube timer app on Google Play that is:

a) not ridden with ads
b) looks nice


So I tried to make my own! 


Long press anywhere to start inspection. The app will count the 15 seconds for you.
Tap the screen when your solve is done. The timer stops when your finger touches the screen.

Above the timer is a randomly generated scramble.
Below the timer is the most recent 5 solves and below that is the average of those 5 solves.

Hit the trashcan button to remove the most recent solve or the lightbulb to toggle light/dark themes.

Swipe up to access your solve statistics and view/remove your past solves! (swipe to get back to the timer screen)


Let me know if you have any ideas to make the app better!
